ways sorting soring algorithems


1.Time complexity
2.Space complexity-in place=quickSort,growing=mergesort
3.stability-1sttime ishan=90,saman=90 second time saman=90,ishan=90 ===>unstable
4.Internal and External - in Ram or Disk
5.Recursive or non 


Selection Sort
______________

1. there are set of cards get first and compare it with all other cards get smallest one and swap

4 5 2 3 9


4 5 3 9    2

4 5 9    2  3

5 9    2 3 4

5 9   2 3 4 5

    2 3 4 5 9

 sorted== 2 3 4 5 9


BubbleSort
__________


2. In bubble sort we we get first card and check it with card next to it if its high swap

 4 3 2 1

forloop1  forloop2
0         4321 3421 3241 3214
1         3214 2314 2134 
2         2134 1234
3         1234


SelectionSort

3. we  have cards as 3 2 1 and selection sort goes like this
   we hav 3 cards we keep first card aside and start with second


3 2 1

3 | hole 1 

3>2=hole value

hole 3 1

hole=2=hole value

2 3 | hole

3>1=hole value

2 | hole 3

2>1=hole value

hole 2 3

hole=1=hole value
