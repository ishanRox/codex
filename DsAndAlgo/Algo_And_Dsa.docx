Algorithems

Algorithms have a long history and the word can be traced back to the 9th century. At this time the Persian scientist, astronomer and mathematician Abdullah Muhammad bin Musa al-Khwarizmi, often cited as “The father of Algebra”, was indirect responsible for the creation of the term “Algorithm”.

We going to learn about sorting algorithems and  time complexity and many more topics.
 

Time complexity

Time complexity why should we care ?

Imagine ram and sham got a problem from mr computer to calculate weather a number is prime or not .Prime numbers are numbers that have only 2 factors: 1 and themselves. 

So ram got a loop running from (2 to n-1)

Sham got a loop from (2 to √n)
*how this happen – think like this if we check 8 is prime or not we dont have to check no more than half of it like 6,7 for sure cant divide 8 without remainders.
.

There was no difference between both until n got bigger and bigger lets see what happen By a picture.









Here n is value in last value ram takes 115 days and sham takes only 1.66 minutes
in computer science solutions like in ram denoted by O(n) because Time propotional to n.And in sham like solutions Time propotional to √n it O(√n).
